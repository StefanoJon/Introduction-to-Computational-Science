# Caption for the figures of Lab 2
The above figures are graphs of the average cycle lengths of all wolfram rules. Each value
for cycle length seen in the graphs is an average taken from cycle length measurements for
system sizes 1 through 10. The two different figures are also to be seen as a comparison
between the cycle lengths when the initial values are random or predetermined. The
predetermined value is static and set to zeroes with a 1 in the middle of the series of zeroes.
Each wolfram rule also has a colour based on its class.

The difference between having random initial values, and predetermined initial values is, as
seen in the figures, minimal. The average cycle length of all wolfram rules differs by 0.03
between the random and predetermined initial values. This is thus an insignificant difference.
This leads to the conclusion that the wolfram rules lead to identical cycles, regardless of
whether the initial values are predetermined or random.

Finally, there are significant differences to be seen between the wolfram classes. Class 1
yields the lowest cycle lengths, whereas classes 2 and 4 yield higher cycle lengths. Class 4
also gives relatively high peaks, but class 3 yields by far the highest cycle lengths, including
high peaks.
